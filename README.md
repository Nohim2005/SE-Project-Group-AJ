Scenario

ABC is a leading cinema in the business of film industry. One of the key drawbacks of the ABC cinema is its obsolete website. Compared to the inception of the ABC cinema, now the business has evolved extensively. Hence, new features like:

•	Online reservation of tickets / seats
•	Online payment handling
•	Avoid booking collisions
•	Visualization of the customer feedbacks for managerial decision making
•	SMS or Email notification of reservation and cancelling options

Need to be integrated. 

The modern website should be revolutionized with the user of JSP / Servlet technologies.
